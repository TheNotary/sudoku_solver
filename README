First, everything in CODE/ was written by Tethik and not me.  

Second, this app is just an html interface to solve sudoku puzzles with.  It's really ugly right now.  

To get started, 

$  git clone git://github.com/TheNotary/sudoku_solver.git
$  cd sudoku_solver
$  chmod 0744 CODE/Sudoku.rb
$  rails s

From their, you should be able to safely navigate to 

http://localhost:3000/solve.html

and see this bad boy in action.
